Data Responsability
===================

- **NBIS & Uppnex** Unfortunately, we do not have resources to keep any files associated with the support request. We suggest that you safely store the results delivered by us. In addition, we ask that you remove the files from UPPMAX/UPPNEX after analysis is completed. The main storage at UPPNEX is optimized for high-speed and parallel access, which makes it expensive and not the right place for long time archiving.
- **Sensitive data** Please note that special considerations may apply to the human-derived sensitive personal data. These should be handled according to specific laws and regulations.
- **Long-term backup** The responsibility for data archiving lies with universities and we recommend asking your local IT for support with long-term data archiving. Also the newly established Data Office at SciLifeLab may be of help to discuss other options.
